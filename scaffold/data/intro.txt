Welcome to the classic Russian linguistic fun.

I will make a word from 3 to 7 letters.
Try to guess it all.
You have the opportunity to make mistakes
up to 7 times or you will end up on the SCAFFOLD.

The game has the option to choose from dictionaries:
  - Russian ('ะต' == 'ั')
  - English.

GOOD LUCK!
