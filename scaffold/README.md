# SCAFFOLD (0.2.3)

Welcome to the classic Russian linguistic fun :)

I will make a word from 3 to 7 letters. Try to guess it all.

You have the opportunity to make mistakes up to 7 times or you will end up on the SCAFFOLD.

The game has the option to choose from (dictionaries are located in the "dat–∞" folder"):
- Russian
- English.

You can play again.

To start the game just run `ruby scaffold.rb`

GOOD LUCK!
